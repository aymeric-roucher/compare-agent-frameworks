This repo is built to compare the implementation of different agent frameworks:
- MetaGPT
- LangChain
- CrewAI
- AutoGen
- Qwen agent

The goal will be the same in each script:
Build a team of two agents, one manager that can execute code, and one managed agent that can do basic web searches.
We'll use GPT-4o for all.
